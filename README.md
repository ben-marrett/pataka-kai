# Welcome to the pātaka kai initial concept.

This is a work in progress that aims to create a digital storehouse, available for communities where
members can post what they have to share, and also search for items they are short of.

To start the development server with a watcher that rebuilds the code, run `npm run dev`. View on: http://localhost:3000

The assets built by webpack are placed in `server/public`. This folder is defined as a static folder in an Express.js server that can be started with `npm run server`.
