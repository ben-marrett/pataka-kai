# Welcome to the pƒÅtaka kai initial concept.

This is a work in progress that aims to create a digital storehouse, available for communities where
members can post what they have to share, and also search for items they are short of.
Initially the concept was for vegetable growers and people with fruit trees to be able to share
surplus and let each other know what is in the process of growing and when it will be ready.
After receiving some feedback, it sounds like another option might be to open it up so that ALL food
items could be made available, whether a tin of beans in the pantry or some fresh baked bread.

To be continued....
